    <h2>On mine arm shall they trust</h2>
    <p>Isaiah 51:5</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    In seasons of severe trial, the Christian has nothing on earth that he can trust to, and is therefore compelled to
    cast himself on his God alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    When his vessel is on its beam ends, and no human deliverance can avail, he must simply and entirely trust himself
    to the providence and care of God. Happy storm that wrecks a man on such a rock as this! O blessed hurricane that
    drives the soul to God and God alone!
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no getting at our God sometimes because of the multitude of our friends; but when a man is so poor, so
    friendless, so helpless that he has nowhere to turn, he files into this Father’s arms, and is blessedly clasped
    therein! When he is burdened with troubles so pressing and peculiar, that he cannot tell them to any but his God,
    he may be thankful for them; for he will learn more of his Lord then than at any other time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh, tempest tossed believer, it is a happy trouble that drives thee to thy Father! Now that thou hast only thy God
    to trust to, see that thou puttest thy full confidence in him. Dishonour not thy Lord and Master by unworthy
    doubts and fears; but be strong in faith, giving glory to God.
  </p>
  <p>
    Show the world that thy God is worth ten thousand worlds to thee. Show rich men how rich thou art in thy poverty
    when the Lord God is thy helper. Show the strong man how strong thou art in thy weakness when underneath thee are
    the everlasting arms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now is the time for feats of faith and valiant exploits. Be strong and very courageous, and the Lord thy God shall
    certainly, as surely as he built the heavens and the earth, glorify himself in thy weakness, and magnify his might
    in the midst of thy distress. The grandeur of the arch of heaven would be spoiled if the sky were supported by a
    single visible column, and your faith would lose glory if it rested on anything discernible by the carnal eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    May the Holy Spirit give you to rest in Jesus this closing day of the month.
